# Difference Between Protists and Protozoa

### **Protists** are an extraordinarily diverse group, including species with various life cycles, morphological specializations, and nutritional needs.

---

# Protists
  - Can be unicellular or multicellular.
  
  - Includes organisms with various nutritional method (photosynthetic, heterotrophic).

  - Not a single taxonomic group, but a category for eukaryotes **that are not plants, animals, or fungi.**


---

### **Protozoa are a subset of protists**, primarily characterized as unicellular, heterotrophic, (non-photosynthetic), motile organisms that are always unicellular.

 
  - Often motile, using structures like cilia, flagella, or pseudopodia.
  - Typically found in aquatic or moist environments.

---


# Understanding these differences helps clarify their roles in ecosystems and their biological significance.

  - Feeds on small particulate food sources like bacteria.
  
- **Cyst**: A cell with a protective wall.
  - Formed through **encystment** when environmental conditions are harsh.
  
  - **Excystment** occurs when conditions become favorable again.

# Section 5.2 Parasitic Helminths
### **Helminths** are large, multicellular organisms, also known as parasitic worms classified within the **animal kingdom.** These organisms are visible to the naked eye in their adult stages, but microscopic in various stages of the reproductive cycle.

![alt text bg right](<Ch.5 Eukaryotes Lecture/animal.jpg>)

# Helminths are divided into two major groups:
  
  - ## **Roundworms (Nematoda)**
  
  - ## **Flatworms (Platyhelminthes)**

---

## Characteristics of Helminths

- Helminths have complex life cycles, often involving multiple hosts.
- They have specialized organ systems, including digestive, excretory, nervous, and reproductive systems.
- Helminths are often highly adapted to their parasitic lifestyle.

---
## Major Groups of Helminths

### Roundworms (Nematoda)

- Unsegmented worms with a complete digestive system.
- Examples include:
  - *Ascaris lumbricoides*: Causes ascariasis, affects the intestines.
  - *Enterobius vermicularis*: Causes pinworm infection, affects the intestines.

- Segmented or unsegmented worms, often with complex life cycles.
- Divided into two classes:
  - **Flukes (Trematoda)**: Non-segmented flatworms.
    - *Schistosoma spp.*: Causes schistosomiasis, affects the blood and liver.
  - **Tapeworms (Cestoda)**: Segmented flatworms.

## Life Cycles of Helminths

### Roundworms

- **Ascaris lumbricoides**: Eggs ingested, larvae hatch in intestines, migrate to lungs, then return to intestines to mature.
  
- **Enterobius vermicularis**: Eggs ingested, larvae hatch in intestines, adults live in the colon, females lay eggs around the anus.
  
- **Necator americanus**: Larvae penetrate skin, travel to lungs, then to intestines to mature.

- **Dracunculus medinensis**: Larvae ingested through contaminated water, mature in body tissues, females migrate to skin to release larvae.

---

## Flatworms

- **Schistosoma spp.**: Larvae (cercariae) penetrate skin, mature in blood vessels, eggs excreted in feces or urine, hatch in water, infect snails, and repeat the cycle.
  
- **Taenia solium**: Eggs ingested through contaminated food, larvae hatch and form cysts in muscles, mature tapeworms develop in the intestines.

---

## Morphology of Helminths

- ### **Roundworms (Nematoda)**:
  - Cylindrical, elongated bodies.
  - Complete digestive system with a distinct mouth and anus.
  - Separate sexes (male and female).

- ### **Flatworms (Platyhelminthes)**:
  - Flattened bodies.
  - Simple digestive system, often with a single opening.
  - Hermaphroditic (both male and female reproductive organs in one individual).

---

## Summary

- Helminths are parasitic worms classified into roundworms and flatworms.
  
- They have complex life cycles and can affect various body systems.
  
- Understanding their morphology and life cycles is crucial for diagnosing and treating infections.

# Section 5.3 Fungus

**Fungi** are a diverse group of organisms that are heterotrophic and typically **saprozoic**, playing crucial roles in decomposition, nutrient cycling, and as symbionts.

Fungi include both microscopic (yeasts and molds) and macroscopic (mushrooms) species.

---

## Characteristics of Fungi

- Fungi have unique cell walls containing **chitin.**
  
- Their cell membranes contain ergosterols, which are targets for antifungal drugs.
  
- Fungi reproduce both sexually and asexually through spores.

---

## Major Groups of Fungi - Molds

- Multicellular fungal bodies composed of filaments called **hyphae**.
- Hyphae form a network called a mycelium.
- Examples:
  - *Rhizopus stolonifer*: Common bread mold.

---

## Major Groups of Fungi - Yeasts

- Unicellular fungi.
- Reproduce asexually by budding.
- Examples:
  - *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*: Baker's yeast.
  - *Candida albicans*: Causes candidiasis.

---

## Dimorphic Fungi

## Some fungi can exist in both mold and yeast forms depending on environmental conditions.

Examples:
- *Histoplasma capsulatum*: Causes histoplasmosis.
  
- *Candida albicans*: Causes vaginal yeast infections, oral thrush, and candidiasis of the skin.

## Medically Significant Fungi

| Scientific Name              | Disease Caused         | System Affected     |
|------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| *Candida albicans*           | Candidiasis            | Skin, Oral, Genital |
| *Histoplasma capsulatum*     | Histoplasmosis         | Respiratory System  |
| *Cryptococcus neoformans*    | Cryptococcosis         | CNS                 |
| *Aspergillus fumigatus*      | Aspergillosis          | Respiratory System  |
| *Trichophyton spp.*          | Athlete's foot, ringworm| Skin, Nails         |

---

## Life Cycles and Reproduction of Fungi - **Asexual Reproduction**

## Fungi reproduce asexually by:
  - **Budding**: Common in yeasts like *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*.
  - **Spore Formation**: Conidia (asexual spores) are produced by molds like *Aspergillus*.

---

## Life Cycles and Reproduction of Fungi - **Sexual Reproduction**

## Involves the formation of specialized sexual structures.

Examples:
- **Ascospores** in *Ascomycota* (e.g., *Saccharomyces*)
- **Basidiospores** in *Basidiomycota* (e.g., mushrooms).

---

## Morphology of Fungi

- **Hyphae**: Filamentous structures that make up the mycelium of molds.
  - **Septate Hyphae**: Have walls between cells.
  - **Coenocytic Hyphae**: Lack walls between cells, forming a continuous cytoplasmic mass.

- **Yeasts**: Unicellular fungi that reproduce by budding.

- **Dimorphic Fungi**: Can exist as both molds and yeasts depending on environmental conditions.

---

## Summary

- Fungi are a diverse group of organisms, important in various ecological roles and as pathogens.
- They include molds, yeasts, and dimorphic fungi with distinct characteristics.
- Understanding their morphology, life cycles, and reproductive strategies is crucial for diagnosing and treating fungal infections.
