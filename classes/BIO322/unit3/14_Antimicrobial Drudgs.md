# **Ayurveda** means 'the knowledge of life' or 'the science of lifeâ€™.

- ## Oldest form of healthcare in the world, discovered in ancient Hindu scriptures called the **Vedas**
- ## Over 5000 years old 
- ## Theory of Bio-energies and yoga are rooted in these ideas

# For millennia, Chinese herbalists have used many different species of plants for the treatment of a wide variety of human ailments. Chinese â€“ Traditional Chinese medicines â€“ a great herbal system.
- ## Shen Nong compiled list of 365 herbal drugs in 2000 BC
- ## Acupuncture, tai chi, Yin and Yang

# Year: 1909

#####  **Paul Ehrlich** made an important discovery with compound 606, an antimicrobial agent that proved to be an effective treatment for syphilis.
- ##### He synthesized Salvarsan containing arsenic in **1909**
- #### Abandoned in the 1940â€™s because powder form was unstable and hard to administer
- ##### His method was important, testing over 600 compounds

# Year: 1928
# **Alexander Fleming** was the first to discover a naturally produced antibiotic, **penicillin**.

- ## Returned to work after vacation and looked some old plates of staphylococci
- ## The mold _Penicillium notatum_ had started to grow on the plates, and inhibited the staphylococcal growth.



---

# Year: 1939

# German researchers won the Nobel prize in 1939 for  discovering that a dye cured streptococcal and staphylococcal infections.

# This led to Sulfanilamide, the precursor to class of sulfa drugs, and the **first synthetic antimicrobial agent.**


---

# Year: 1940's

- # Penicillin is purified
- # Efficacy tested in animal and human trials 
- # After crystallography was used to determine structure, **semisynthetic** antimicrobial drugs were born.

# Year: cir. 1950's

## Selman Waksman was the first to show the vast antimicrobial production capabilities of a group of **soil bacteria**, Actinobacteria.

## Bacteria in soil, specifically genus **_Streptomyces_** are source for *_half of all natural ABT's._*

# Routes of Administration

# **Bacteriostatic Drugs** cause reversible inhibition of bacterial growth. 
- ## Growth resumes after drug elimination)

# **Bactericidal drugs** kill target bacteria.
- ## Important for immunocompromised patients
- ## Required for life-threatening infections (e.g., acute endocarditis)


---

# Narrow-Spectrum Antimicrobials

- ## Target specific subsets of bacteria (e.g., only gram-positive or gram-negative)
- ## **Used when the pathogen is identified**, minimizing collateral damage to normal microbiota
  
---

# Broad-Spectrum Antimicrobials

- ## Target a wide variety of bacteria (both gram-positive and gram-negative)
- ## **Used as empiric therapy** before pathogen identification
- ## Suitable for polymicrobic infections and prophylactic prevention

---

# Superinfection Risk

- ## Broad-spectrum antimicrobials can disrupt normal microbiota
- ## May lead to secondary infections, e.g., 
  - ### yeast infections (candidiasis)
  - ### pseudomembranous colitis (caused by _Clostridium difficile_)

# Class: Avermectins (belong to macrolide)
# Examples: IvermectinÂ®
- Treats roundworm disease
- For humans, IvermectinÂ® tablets are approved at very specific doses to treat some parasitic worms
-  Topical (on the skin) formulations for head lice and skin conditions like rosacea are also available.
### MOA: Blocks neuronal transmission by binding to cell membrane gated channels common to invertebrates (e.g. lice, mites, bed bugs)
