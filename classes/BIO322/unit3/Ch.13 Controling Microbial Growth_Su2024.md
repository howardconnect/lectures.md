# Chapter 13 - Controlling Microbial Growth 
###### Justin N. Howard · Campbellsville University · Summer 2024

<!-- _footer: -->

---

## Overview
- Importance of microbial control in healthcare, food industry, and laboratories.
- Methods of controlling microbial growth: physical and chemical.

---

13.1 Controlling Microbial Growth

# A **fomite** is any inanimate objects that can harbor microbes.

---

## **Biosafety** includes the safe practices that reduce a laboratory worker’s risk of exposure to potentially infectious microbes, and limits contamination of the work environment, while protecting the general public.

# BIOSAFETY LEVELS

4 biosafety levels: Each level has specific controls for containment of microbes and biological agents. ​

- The primary risks that determine levels of containment are **infectivity, diseases severity, transmission, and the nature of the work.​**

- Origins and route of exposure are factored for the considered microbes.​

# Biosafety Level 1 (BSL-1)
- ##  The basic level of protection and is appropriate for defined and characterized strains of viable biological agents.
  
- ## Agents are not known to cause disease in immunocompetent adult humans​.

- ## **No primary barriers required**; protective laboratory clothing; protective face &  eyewear, as needed.

---

# Biosafety Level 2 (BSL-2)

- ### Appropriate for handling moderate-risk agents that cause human disease of varying severity.
- ### Exposure routes included here are **ingestion or through percutaneous or mucous membrane exposure**.​
- ### Limited access to personel such as occupational medical services,  including medical evaluation, surveillance, and treatment, as appropriate. 
- ### All procedures that **may generate an aerosol or splash** conducted in a biosafety container.

---

# Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3)

- ## Reserved for agents with a known potential for **aerosol transmission.**
- ## The agents that may cause serious and potentially lethal infections, and are **indigenous or exotic in origin.**
- ## Two pairs of gloves when appropriate; respiratory protection, as needed.

---

# Biosafety Level 4 (BSL-4)

- ## Exotic agents that pose a high individual risk of life-threatening disease by infectious aerosols.
- ## No treatment is available for these pathogens.
- ## Restricted to high containment laboratories that meet BSL-4 guidelines.​
- ## Full-body, air-supplied, positive-pressure suit ​

# **Disinfection** and **antisepsis** are _methods_ to reduce microbial load.

---

## _Disinfectants_ are chemical agents used to eliminate or reduce harmful microorganisms **on inanimate objects and surfaces.**
- #### They are typically applied to surfaces such as floors, walls, countertops, and medical instruments.
- #### Often more potent than antiseptics.

### **Examples:** Bleach and phenolic compounds. 

---

## _Antiseptics_ are chemical agents used to eliminate or reduce harmful microorganisms **on living tissues.**
- #### Applied to skin, mucous membranes, and wounds to prevent infection. 
- #### Formulated to be safe for use on human tissues. 

### **Examples:** Hydrogen peroxide, iodine solutions, and alcohol based sanitizers. 

---

# **Aseptic technique** involves practices and procedures to prevent contamination from pathogens.
# It aims to create an environment that is free from harmful microorganisms



---

## Key Principles
- **Hand Hygiene**: Thorough washing and sanitizing of hands before and after procedures.
- **Sterilization**: Use of sterilized instruments and equipment.
- **Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)**: Wearing gloves, masks, gowns, and other protective clothing.
- **Environmental Controls**: Maintaining clean and sterile environments.
- **Proper Technique**: Using correct procedures to handle sterile items and perform tasks.

## Common Practices
- **Sterilizing Instruments**: Methods such as autoclaving, dry heat, or chemical sterilization.
- **Creating Sterile Fields**: Ensuring that areas where procedures are performed are kept sterile.
- **Using Barriers**: Gloves, gowns, drapes, and masks to create a barrier against contamination.
- **Aseptic Handling**: Proper techniques to handle instruments and materials without contaminating them.

# "The most extreme method for microbial control is **sterilization,** the complete removal or killing of all vegetative cells, endospores, and viruses."

## Common Protocols for Control of Microbial Growth

| Protocol     | Definition | Common Application | Common Agents |
|--------------|-------------|--------------------|---------------|
| **Sterilization** | Complete elimination of all microbes, including spores. | Surgical instruments, IV fluids | Autoclaving, ethylene oxide gas |
| **Disinfection** | Inactivates **most** microbes on fomites using chemicals or heat | Laboratory benches, clinical surfaces, bathroom sinks | Chlorine bleach, alcohols, phenolics |
| **Antisepsis** | Safe for living tissue | Skin, mucous membranes | Hydrogen peroxide, isopropyl alcohol |

---


| Protocol     | Definition | Common Application | Common Agents |
|--------------|-------------|--------------------|---------------|
| **Sanitization** | Cleansing of fomites to remove enough microbes for public health safety | Commercial dishwashers, hospital surfaces | Hot water, chemical disinfectants |
| **Degerming** | Reducing microbial load on skin or tissue by gentle scrubbing with mild chemicals | Handwashing, alcohol swabs at injection sites | Soap, alcohol |

## Using Physical Methods to Control Microorganisms

- **Heat**: Dry-heat and moist-heat sterilization.
- **Pasteurization**: Reduces spoilage microbes in food.
- **Cold Temperatures**: Refrigeration and freezing slow microbial growth.
- **High-Pressure Processing**: Kills microbes in food.
- **Desiccation and Lyophilization**: Preserve foods by reducing water activity.
- **Radiation**: Ionizing and nonionizing for sterilization.
- **Filtration**: HEPA and membrane filters in healthcare and labs.

---

## Using Chemicals to Control Microorganisms

- **Heavy Metals**: Mercury, silver, copper, and zinc.
- **Halogens**: Chlorine, fluorine, and iodine.
- **Alcohols**: Ethyl and isopropyl alcohol.
- **Phenolics**: Household cleaners and disinfectants.
- **Surfactants**: Soaps and detergents.
- **Alkylating Agents**: Effective but carcinogenic.
- **Peroxygens**: Strong oxidizing agents.
- **Chemical Preservatives**: Inhibit microbial growth in foods.

---

## Testing the Effectiveness of Antiseptics and Disinfectants

- **Phenol Coefficient**: Historical measure of disinfectant effectiveness.
- **Disk-Diffusion Method**: Measures zones of inhibition.
- **Use-Dilution Test**: Disinfection effectiveness on surfaces.
- **In-Use Test**: Monitors contamination in clinical settings.


---

## Summary
- Understanding and applying microbial control methods are crucial in healthcare, food industry, and research settings.
- Testing the effectiveness of antiseptics and disinfectants ensures proper implementation of microbial control.
