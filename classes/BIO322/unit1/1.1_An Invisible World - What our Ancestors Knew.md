# 1.1 An Invisible World - What Our Ancestors Knew





###### Summer '24
Justin N. Howard
Campbellsville University


---

# Main Points

- Beacuse it is hard to see without microscopes, the complex unseen world of microorganisms goes unoticed.
  
- Many historical figures with varying backgrounds (some that did not attend college) contirbuted to what we know today.
  
- Some tools in the microbiology lab are basic and common just like kitchen tools. 

---

- Learning Objectives:

  - Describe ancestral improvements in food with invisible microbes.
  
  - Explain ancient causes of sickness and disease before microscopes.
  
  - Identify key events in the birth of microbiology.

## Clinical Focus - Cora's Meningitis Case

- Background: Cora, a 41-year-old lawyer, shows symptoms indicating possible meningitis.
  
- Diagnostic steps: Lumbar puncture for CSF analysis, including visual examination, microscopic analysis, and Gram staining.
  
- Treatment: Antibiotics, pending culture results.

## Fermented Foods and Beverages

- Historical evidence of fermentation since 7000 BC.

- Importance of microbial fermentation in producing beer, wine, bread, yogurt, cheese, and pickled vegetables.

## The Iceman Treateth - Prehistoric Disease Understanding

- Insights from Ötzi the Iceman: Prehistoric disease treatment methods(?)

---
"At around 48 years of age, Ötzi was older than the average of his contemporaries...fairly old (for his time). And not healthy."

"..Suffered from tooth decay, periodontal disease and borreliosis. 

He also had gastritis and was infected with the _helicobacter_ stomach bacterium."



---

- Imagine dealing with Lyme disease over 5,000 years ago. 

- The evidence found with Ötzi gives us insights into how ancient people might have approached such health challenges.

- Early practices like quarantining and hygiene.

---
### Hippocrates(4960-370 BC)
Often called the father of Western medicine, shifted the paradigm from supernatural explanations of disease to natural causes. This was a monumental step forward in medical thinking.

### Thucydides (460-394 BC)

![Historical Medical Pioneers bg center right 60% ](unit1images/Fig1.5a.jpg)
He survived the  Athenian plague. His recognition of immunity in survivors was an early, yet significant, understanding of how our bodies fight off disease.

- He noted survivors of thes disease did not get sick again.

--- 
### Marcus Terentius Varro (166-27 BC)


- Varro's hypothesis about invisible creatures causing diseases shows that the concept of microorganisms was being considered long before they were actually seen.

## Check Your Understanding

## 1. Name two foods historically produced with microbial aid.
   
---

## The Birth of Microbiology

- Microscopy's role in confirming the existence of microbes.
  
- Contributions of Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, Louis Pasteur, and Robert Koch.

---
![Historical figures bg contain left](unit1images/leeuwenhoek.jpg)

## Antonie van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723)
Discovery of microorganisms with his powerful microscope.
- Recognition of microbes' existence and the start of a new scientific era.
- Progression from the hypothesis of "invisible forces" to concrete microscopic evidence.
- Advances in understanding microbial fermentation, pasteurization, and disease causation.

---
200 years later, the 'Golden Age' of Microbiology began (1857-1914)
## Louis Pasteur(1822-1895)
![Historical Medical Pioneers bg right scale](unit1images/Fig1.6.jpg)
Pasteur's work is a cornerstone of microbiology. He not only developed pasteurization but also made groundbreaking strides in understanding microbial fermentation and developing vaccines.
  
---

## Robert Koch (1843-1910)

![Historical Medical Pioneers bg left](unit1images/Fig1.6a.jpg)

Koch's work in identifying the specific bacteria causing diseases like anthrax and cholera fundamentally changed our approach to diagnosing and treating infections.

---

| Koch's Postualtes|
| --------  |
| 1. The suspected pathogen must be found in every case of the disease and be found in healthy individuals|
| 2. The suspected pathogen can be isolated and grown in pure culture |
| 3. A healthy test subject infected with the suspected pathogen must develop the same signs and symptoms of disease in #1 |
| 4. The pathogen must be re-isolated from the new host and must be identical to the pathogen from # 2|
