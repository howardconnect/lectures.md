# BIOL 322 Med Micro ​
## Safety in the lab​
x
<hr>

Justin Howard · Campbellsville University · Spring 2023

---
# Objectives in the Lab

- Fundamental concepts and principles related to microbiology.​

- Role of microorganisms in the environment/food and as they relate to human health.​

- Characteristics and classification strategies for prokaryotic organisms.​

- Identify methods used to control microorganisms in the environment and the chemical control of microorganisms in the human body.
  ​

# General Safety in the Lab
<hr>

- Wear protective clothing:
- No open toed shoes​
- No tank tops​
- Wear lab coats, gloves, glasses if possible​
- Turn off incinerators when not in use.​
- Tie back long hair.​
- Limit your contact to cultures if you are sick.​
- If you are pregnant or immunocompromised for any reason, please alert the instructor asap.​

---

# General Safety in the Lab
<hr>

- Broken glass – broken glass container.​
- Locate first aid kit, emergency shower, fire extinguisher, eye wash for emergencies.

---

# Best Practices
<hr>

# Please​


- Don’t chew on your pens or fingers.​
- Do not tip agar plates above your face.​
- Do not mouth pipette.​
- Don’t touch the cultures.​
- Minimize exposure to all bacteria.
- Do not eat, lick, snort the bacteria or viruses.​

# Standard Microbial Practices
<hr>



# Biosafety includes the safe practices that reduce a laboratory worker’s risk of exposure to potentially infectious microbes, and limits contamination of the work environment, while protecting the general public.​

---

# Standard Microbial Practices
<hr>

- Hand hygiene after handling of microbes.​
- Keep fingernails trimmed; no artificial nails, tips, or nail glue-on decorations.​
- No eating, drinking, or cosmetic application.​
- Do not adjust or take out your contacts.​
- Electronics kept in one place, use out of class as needed (not while handling microbes).​

---

# Standard Microbial Practices
<hr>

- No removing cultures from the lab.​
- Routinely decontaminate work surfaces.​
- Microbes must be disposed of properly:​
- Liquid cultures need to be autoclaved.​
- Agar plates and solid wastes must be disinfected with bleach and placed in biohazard waste.​

---
# Standard Microbial Practices
<hr>

- Spray bench tops with 70% ethanol at the beginning of class and at the end.​
- Tubes should always be upright in a rack.​
- Cover spills with paper towels and notify the instructor immediately.​

# BIOSAFETY LEVELS
<hr>

- 4 biosafety levels: Each level has specific controls for containment of microbes and biological agents. ​

- The primary risks that determine levels of containment are **infectivity, diseases severity, transmission, and the nature of the work.​**

- Considered are the origins and the route of exposure for considered microbes.​

---

 # BIOSAFETY LEVELS
 <hr>

# BSL-1
- Biosafety Level 1 (BSL-1) is the basic level of protection and is appropriate for defined and characterized strains of viable biological agents.
  
- Agent are not known to cause disease in immunocompetent adult humans​

- No primary barriers required; protective laboratory clothing; protective face &  eyewear, as needed

---

# BSL-2
<hr>

- Biosafety Level 2 (BSL-2) is appropriate for handling moderate-risk agents that cause human disease of varying severity.
- Exposure routes included here are **ingestion or through percutaneous or mucous membrane exposure**.​
- Limited access to personell such as occupational medical services,  including medical evaluation, surveillance, and treatment, as appropriate. 
- All procedures that may generate an aerosol or splash conducted in a **Biosafety Container** decontamination process needed for laboratory equipment​.

---

# BSL-3

- Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) is appropriate for agents with a known potential for aerosol transmission.
- The agents that may cause serious and potentially lethal infections, and that are indigenous or exotic in origin.
- Two pairs of gloves when appropriate; respiratory protection, as needed.

---

# BSL-4

<hr>

- Exotic agents that pose a high individual risk of life-threatening disease by infectious aerosols.
-  No treatment is available for these pathogens.
- Restricted to high containment laboratories that meet Biosafety Level 4 (BSL-4) guidelines.​

- Full-body, air-supplied, positive-pressure suit ​
