# 3.1 Spontaneous Generation

<hr>

 Introduction

---

# Life takes many forms and share many characteristics that we can see

# The microscope changed how we understand the invisible world

# Spontaneous Generation

## Aristotle postulated 'life' or living things could arise from non-living material - _if_ that material contained _pneuma_ or 'vital heat'.


---

# Francesco Redi (1626-1697) Italian physician

## Until the 17th century that was the accepted theory.

## He developed an experiment to test it.

---

# Redi's 1668 experiment was a landmark in refuting the theory of spontaneous generation. 
- ## He predicted that by preventing flies from contacting the meat, there would be no maggots observed on that sample.
- ## Two jars were left OTA, 2 were covered with gauze, and 2 were sealed.

---

# Redi's hypothesis was supported by the observation that magots only formed in meat contained in unsealed jars. 

# He also concluded the maggots were the offspring of the flies ðŸª°


---

# Spontaneous Generation was argued until the 19th century.

# Paris Academy of Sciences offered a prize to anyone who could resolve the problem.

# Louis Pasteur definitely disproved the theory.

---

# The flasks were filled with broth and sterilized by boiling.

# Air was allowed to reach the broth, but the flasks prevented microbes from entering the flask.

---

# The broth in the flasks remained sterile until the long-twisted necks were removed from the glass flasks.

# Pasteur claimed *_"Omne vivum ex vivo"_*

# Life only comes from life.

# 3.2 Modern Cell Theory
<hr>


---
# Modern Cell Theory involves two basic tenets:

# 1. All cells arise from other cells (biogenesis).
# 2. Cells are the fundamental basic units of life.

# The road to Modern Cell Theory
<hr>

1. Robert Hooke - in 1665 he described "small chambers"  within cork (cork is made of plant material).
   
2. 200 Years later (in 1838) a German botanists described them as "cells" but thought they "crystalized" to form or be produced.
   
3. At the same time, a German physiologists was looking at animal cells with a microscope.

---
# The road to Modern Cell Theory
<hr>

# The two German scientists got together and realized they were seeing a lot of similarities between plant and animal cells.

---
# The road to Modern Cell Theory
<hr>

## Cir. 1850, two polish scientist developed what we today call modern cell theory. 

## One of them, a pathologist named Rudolf Virchow, coined the term *_omnis cellula a cellula_* -

# All cells arise from cells.

---

# Endosymbiotic Theory
<hr>

# While the mentioned scientists were looking at and discussing cells themselves, some were looking at the internal structures of cells.


---
# Endosymbiotic Theory
<hr>

# 1831: Robert Brown observes nuclei in plant cells. 
# Cir. 1880: Andrew Schimper describes chloroplasts, including their 
- ## job during photosynthesis.
- ## division and replication apart from the nucleus.

---

# 1905: A Russian scientists hypothesized chloroplasts were once symbiotic organisms that originated from photosynthetic bacteria living in a eukaryotic cell. 

---

# Symbiosis describes the interaction between two organisms - a close and often long-term interaction between two different biological species.

---

# There are a wide range of relationships that symbiosis refers to.

## **Mutualism** - Both species interact and benefit.

## **Commensalism** - One species benefits, one is not helped or harmed. 

## **Parasitism** - One species benefits at the expense of the other.

# 1920's: Another scientist set out to further the theory with objective investigations that included chloroplasts, mitochondria, and bacteria.

# He claimed mitochondria could be cultured apart from a cell. Scientists believed this was not the real case, and probably, bacteria were contaminating results.

---

# Fast Forward 50 years. Over this time scientists were unaware that organelles contain their own DNA. 

# In the 1960's we became aware of chloroplast and mitochondrial DNA. Microscopes were getting good enough to see the difference between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. 

---

# American Geneticist Lynn Margulis (1938 - 2011)

## In 1967 she published ideas that collected all kinds of evidence supporting endosymbiotic theory of the origins of mitochondria and chloroplasts.

## She argued that mitochondria and chloroplasts were of prokaryotic origins, and presented evidence from advances in fields including microscopy, genetics, molecular biology, fossils, and geological data. 

--- 
# The theory was still not well received, but increasing genetic evidence was motivation for her to write a book.

# Margulis published _Symbiosis in Cell Evolution_ in 1981.

---

# In a nutshell...

## Genetic and phylogenetic data pointed to a relationship between the DNA of ribosomes in mitochondria, chloroplasts, and bacteria.

## Ribosomes in mitochondria and chloroplasts are structurally similar to those in bacteria, all differing from eukaryotic ribosomes.

## These organelles reproduce via Binary fission, which is how bacterial cells reproduce, and different from mitosis in eukaryotic cells.

# The Germ Theory of Disease
<hr>

## Before microbes were discovered in the 17th century, there were a lot of ideas about how disease came about. 

### Ancient Greeks thought 'particles' came from decaying matter (e.g., sewage and cesspits)

# Hand Hygiene

## An obstetrician named Ignaz Semmelweis, his medical students, autopsies, mothers giving birth, midwives, the death of a colleague, and the year 1847.

# Hand Hygiene

## After washing hands in chlorinated lime water, before and after every patient exam, the mortality rate dropped to 1%, just like the midwives. 

## Physicians were slow to adopt the practice because of established norms for that time.

# Enter John Snow and his tracking of the cholera outbreak. 

## Demonstrated that cholera was transmitted in contaminated drinking water.

# Back up provided by Pasteur, Jospeh Lister, and Robert Koch


---
# The Germ Theory of Disease
<hr>

# Pasteur
## Studying beer and wine spoilage, he discovered fermentation. Also, with his flask experiment, he had the thought that if bacteria caused food spoilage, they may also cause disease. 


---

# The Germ Theory of Disease
<hr>

# Joesph Lister 
## Curious about post-surgical infections and familiar with the work of Pasteur and Semmelweis. 

## Insisted on strict hand washing. 
## Started using carbolic acid (phenol).
## The use of antiseptics and disinfectants are still in practice today. 

---
# The Germ Theory of Disease
<hr>

# Robert Koch
## Developed postulates based on the idea that a specific disease could be attributed to a specific microbe.

## Studied cholera, anthrax, and tuberculosis.

# The Germ Theory of disease was finally cemented, and modern humanity finally moved away from ancient ideas about disease.
