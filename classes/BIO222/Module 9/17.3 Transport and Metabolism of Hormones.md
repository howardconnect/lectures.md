#### 17.3 Transport and Metabolism of Hormones

**Binding Proteins**
- Some hormones circulate in the blood bound to binding proteins and are called bound hormones.
- Hormones not bound to binding proteins are called free hormones, and they can interact with their receptor.

**Regulation of Hormone Levels in the Blood**
Two processes regulate the overall blood levels of hormones: negative feedback and positive feedback.
1. Negative feedback prevents further hormone secretion once a set point is achieved.
2. Positive feedback is a self-promoting system whereby the stimulation of hormone secretion increases over time.
3. The length of time a hormone is active in the circulation is termed its half-life.
4. The half-life of some hormones is prolonged because they circulate in the blood bound to binding proteins.
5. Lipid-soluble hormones are eliminated from the blood through conjugation; water soluble hormones can be degraded by proteases.
