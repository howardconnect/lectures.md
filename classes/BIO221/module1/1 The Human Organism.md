# 2.1 Basic Chemistry

---

### Matter, Mass, and Weight

- ## **Matter**: Anything that occupies space and has mass.
- ## **Mass**: The amount of matter in an object.
- ## **Weight**: The gravitational force acting on an object of a given mass.

# International unit for mass: **kilogram (kg)**

---


### Elements and Atoms

# An **element** is simplest type of matter with unique chemical properties; composed of atoms of only one kind.
  
# The smallest particle of an element that has chemical characteristics of that element is an **atom**.

---

### Common Elements in the Body

## The four most common elements: Hydrogen (H), Carbon (C), Nitrogen (N), and Oxygen (O).

#### Other important elements: Fluorine (F), Sodium (Na), Magnesium (Mg), Phosphorus (P), Sulfur (S), Chlorine (Cl), Potassium (K), Calcium (Ca), Iron (Fe), Iodine (I).

### Atomic Structure
# Atoms are composed of subatomic particles:
  - ## **Neutrons**: No electrical charge.
  - ## **Protons**: One positive charge.
  - ## **Electrons**: One negative charge.
  - ## **Nucleus**: Formed by protons and neutrons.
  
# Most of the volume of an atom is occupied by electrons.

---

### Atomic Number and Mass Number

- ## **Atomic Number**: Equal to the number of protons in each atom, which is equal to the number of electrons.
- ## **Mass Number**: Number of protons plus the number of neutrons.

---

### Isotopes and Atomic Mass

- ## **Isotopes**: Two or more forms of the same element with the same number of protons and electrons but different numbers of neutrons.
- ## **Atomic Mass**: Average mass of naturally occurring isotopes.

---

### The Mole and Molar Mass

## **Avogadro‚Äôs Number**: 
- ## **Mole**: Avogadro‚Äôs number of atoms, ions, or molecules.
- ## **Molar Mass**: Mass of one mole of a substance in grams, equal to its atomic mass units.

# 2.2 Chemical Reactions and Energy

---

## Chemical Reactions

- ## **Chemical reaction**: Atoms, ions, molecules, or compounds interact to form or break chemical bonds.
- ##  **Reactants**: Substances that enter into a chemical reaction.
- ##  **Products**: Substances that result from the reaction.

---

## Synthesis Reactions
- ## Two or more reactants chemically combine to form a new and larger product **(anabolism).**

## Decomposition Reactions
- ## A large reactant is broken down to form smaller products **(catabolism).**

---

## Reversible Reactions
- ## Reactions that can proceed from reactants to products or from products to reactants.

## Oxidation-Reduction Reactions
- ## **Oxidation**: Loss of an electron by an atom.
- ## **Reduction**: Gain of an electron by an atom.

---

# **Energy** is the capacity to do work (e.g., to move matter).
  - ## **Potential Energy**: Energy stored in chemical bonds.
  - ## **Kinetic Energy**: Energy that does work and moves matter.
  - ## **Conservation of Energy**: Energy is neither created nor destroyed; it only changes form.

# 2.3 Inorganic Chemistry

---

# Water
- ## Polar nature influences interactions with other molecules.
- ## Water's roles:
  - ### Stabilizes body temperature.
  - ### Protects and lubricates body parts.
  - ### Participates in chemical reactions.
---

# **Hydrophilic**: Substances attracted to water.
# **Hydrophobic**: Substances not attracted to water.
# **Cohesion**: Attraction of one water molecule to another.
# **Adhesion**: Attraction of water molecules to other molecules.


---

### Acids and Bases
- ## **Acid**: A proton donor or any substance that releases hydrogen ions.
- ## **Base**: A proton acceptor or any substance that binds to hydrogen ions.
  
---

# The pH Scale measures the **hydrogen ion** concentration in a solution.
  - ## Neutral: pH 7
  - ## Acidic: pH < 7
  - ## Alkaline: pH > 7


# A **Buffer** is a solution or ion that resists changes in pH when acids or bases are added.

# 2.4 Organic Chemistry

---



# **Carbohydrates**: Composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.
  - ## **Monosaccharides**: Simple sugars (e.g., glucose).
  - ## **Disaccharides**: Two simple sugars bound together (e.g., sucrose).
  - ## **Polysaccharides**: Long chains of monosaccharides (e.g., glycogen).

---

# **Lipids**: Composed mostly of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.
  - **Fats (Triglycerides)**: Composed of glycerol and fatty acids.
  - **Phospholipids**: One fatty acid replaced with a phosphate group.
  - **Steroids**: Lipids with four ring-like structures (e.g., cholesterol).

---

# **Proteins**: Composed of amino acids.
  - ### **Amino Acids**: Building blocks of protein.
## **Protein Structure**
- ### Primary: Amino acid sequence.
- ### Secondary: Hydrogen bonding causes folding.
- ### Tertiary: Large-scale folding.
- ### Quaternary: Association of multiple proteins.

---


# **Nucleic Acids** are composed of nucleotides.
  - ## **DNA**: Genetic material of cells.
  - ## **RNA**: Plays roles in protein synthesis.
  - ## **ATP**: Energy currency of the body.

---

# Important Concepts

## **Electrolytes**: Solutions that conduct electricity.
## **Nonelectrolytes**: Solutions that do not conduct electricity.
  
## **Intermolecular Forces**: Forces between molecules that determine solubility and dissociation.
