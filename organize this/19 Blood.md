# 19.4 Formed Elements

The formed elements are red blood cells (erythrocytes), white blood cells (leukocytes), and platelets (cell fragments).

Production of Formed Elements

Â  Â A. In the embryo and fetus, the formed elements are produced in a number of locations.

Â  Â B. After birth, red bone marrow becomes the source of the formed elements.

Â  Â C. All formed elements are derived from hemocytoblasts, which give rise to two intermediate stem cells: myeloid stem cells and lymphoid stem cells. Myeloid stem cells give rise to red blood cells, platelets, and most of the white blood cells. Lymphoid stem cells give rise to lymphocytes.

  

Red Blood Cells

  

Â  Â A. Red blood cells are biconcave discs containing hemoglobin and carbonic anhydrase.

Â  Â  Â  â€¢ Â A hemoglobin molecule consists of four heme and four globin molecules. The heme molecules transport oxygen, and the globin molecules transport carbon dioxide and nitric oxide. Iron is required for oxygen transport.

Â  Â  Â  â€¢ Â Carbonic anhydrase is involved with the transport of carbon dioxide.

Â  Â B. Erythropoiesis is the production of red blood cells.

â€¢ Â Stem cells in red bone marrow eventually give rise to late erythroblasts, which lose their nuclei and are released into the blood as reticulocytes. Loss of the endoplasmic reticulum by a reticulocyte produces a red blood cell.
â€¢ Â In response to low blood oxygen, the kidneys produce erythropoietin, which stimulates erythropoiesis.

C. Hemoglobin from ruptured red blood cells is phagocytized by macrophages. The hemoglobin is broken down, and heme becomes bilirubin, which is secreted in bile.

  

White Blood Cells

  

A. White blood cells protect the body against microorganisms and remove dead cells and debris.

B. Five types of white blood cells exist.

Â  Â â€¢ Â Neutrophils are small, phagocytic cells.

Â  Â â€¢ Â Eosinophils reduce inflammation.

Â  Â â€¢ Â Basophils release histamine and are involved with increasing the inflammatory response.

Â  Â â€¢ Â Lymphocytes are important in immunity, including the production of antibodies.

Â  Â â€¢ Â Monocytes leave the blood, enter tissues, and become large, phagocytic cells called macrophages.

Platelets

  

Platelets, or thrombocytes, are cell fragments pinched off from megakaryocytes in the red bone marrow.

19.5 Hemostasis

Hemostasis, the stoppage of bleeding, is very important to the maintenance of homeostasis.

Vascular Spasm

Vasoconstriction of damaged blood vessels reduces blood loss.

Platelet Plug Formation

A. Platelets repair minor damage to blood vessels by forming platelet plugs.

â€¢ Â In platelet adhesion, platelets bind to collagen in damaged tissues.

â€¢ Â In the platelet release reaction, platelets release chemicals that activate additional platelets.

â€¢ Â In platelet aggregation, platelets bind to one another to form a platelet plug.

B. Platelets also release chemicals involved with coagulation.

Coagulation

A. Coagulation is the formation of a blood clot.

B. The first stage of coagulation occurs through the extrinsic or intrinsic pathway. Both pathways end with the production of activated Factor X.

â€¢ Â The extrinsic pathway begins with the release of thromboplastin from damaged tissues.

â€¢ Â The intrinsic pathway begins with the activation of Factor XII.

C. Activated Factor X, Factor V, phospholipids, and Ca2+ form prothrombinase.

D. Prothrombin is converted to thrombin by prothrombinase.

E. Fibrinogen is converted to fibrin by thrombin. The insoluble fibrin forms the clot.

Control of Clot Formation

A. Heparin and antithrombin inhibit thrombin activity. Therefore, fibrinogen is not converted to fibrin, and clot formation is inhibited.

B. Prostacyclin counteracts the effects of thrombin.

Clot Retraction and Dissolution

A. Clot retraction results from the contraction of platelets, which pull the edges of damaged tissue closer together.

B. Serum, which is plasma minus fibrinogen and some clotting factors, is squeezed out of the clot.

C. Factor XII, thrombin, tissue plasminogen activator, and urokinase activate plasmin, which dissolves fibrin (the clot).

19.6 Blood Grouping

A. Blood groups are determined by antigens on the surface of red blood cells.

B. Antibodies can bind to red blood cell antigens, resulting in agglutination or hemolysis of red blood cells.

ABO Blood Group

A. Type A blood has A antigens, Type B blood has B antigens, Type AB blood has A and B antigens, and type O blood has neither A nor B antigens.

B. Type A blood has anti-B antibodies, Type B blood has anti-A antibodies, Type AB blood has neither anti-A nor anti-B antibodies, and Type O blood has both anti-A and anti-B antibodies.

C. Mismatching the ABO blood group results in a transfusion reaction.

Rh Blood Group

A. Rh-positive blood has the D antigen, whereas Rh-negative blood does not.

B. Antibodies against the D antigen are produced by an Rh-negative person when the person is exposed to Rh-positive blood.

C. The Rh blood group is responsible for hemolytic disease of the newborn.

19.7 Diagnostic Blood Tests

Type and Crossmatch

Blood typing determines the ABO and Rh blood groups of a blood sample. A crossmatch tests for agglutination reactions between donor and recipient blood.

Complete Blood Count

A complete blood count consists of the following: red blood count, hemoglobin measurement (grams of hemoglobin per 100 ml of blood), hematocrit measurement (percent volume of red blood cells), white blood count, and differential white blood count (the percentage of each type of white blood cell).

Clotting

Platelet count and prothrombin time measurement assess the bloodâ€™s ability to clot.

Blood Chemistry

The composition of materials dissolved or suspended in plasma (e.g., glucose, urea nitrogen, bilirubin, and cholesterol) can be used to assess the functioning and status of the bodyâ€™s systems.

  

Topics Related to Blood Cells and Functions

Students will enjoy the study of blood. Show how red blood cells (RBCs) and platelets get trapped in a net of fibrin. This illustrates the biconcave disc shape of the RBCs, the fragmental nature of platelets, and the fibrous nature of fibrin. Use this to introduce this chapter.

Students can visit blood donation centers and clinics to see procedures. Have them investigate sterile procedures, storage methods, and precautions used in blood collection. This could lead into the discussions about blood typing and blood transfusions. Ask students to predict what happens in the body after a person donates blood.

Have students investigate aspirinâ€™s affect on blood viscosity and clotting time. Have students speculate as to why aspirin is currently being prescribed for patients recuperating from heart attacks and for patients at risk for future heart attacks. Find out current thinking on this topic. Use the Clinical Impact 19.2: Clinical Importance of Taking Aspirin, for information about aspirin.

Have students list all diagnostic blood tests and what they accomplish. What is the diagnostic benefit of assessing blood chemistry? List the parameters. Tables on the ARIS website list normal values and clinical significance of blood, plasma, and serum as well as normal blood count values and their clinical significance.

Themes in Chapter 19

Structure and Function

Blood Components and Functions

Hereâ€™s another great place to emphasize the relationship of structure and function. All parts of the blood accomplish certain functions. Continually ask students to make these connections. Table 19.1 Composition of Plasma, and Table 19.2 Formed Elements of the Blood, will enhance and facilitate this discussion. Study cards are good tools for learning this information.

Homeostasis

Hemostasis

Hemostasis is important to the maintenance of homeostasis. All the sidebars in this chapter can help students understand this relationship. Cover platelet plug formation and coagulation in good detail. Be sure to include how the body dissolves clots and prevents clotting. This, of course, will link to the next chapters on the heart and peripheral circulation.

Blood Disorders

Table 19.4, Representative Diseases and Disorders of the Blood, is a good assignment as a starting point for further research.
