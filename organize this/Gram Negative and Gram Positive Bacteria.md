# Gram-negative and Gram-positive Bacteria

## Introduction to Bacterial Cell Wall

Bacterial cells differ from eukaryotic cells in many ways. One important distinction is the presence of a cell wall. In bacterial cells, the cell wall provides rigidity, protection, and allows cells to maintain a shape (cocci, bacilli, etc.). The main component in most bacterial cell walls is **peptidoglycan (PPG)**.

## Understanding Peptidoglycan

This polymer, unique to bacterial cells, comprises !many polysaccharide chains linked together. The polysaccharide chains are formed with two alternating amino sugars: N-acetylmuramic acid (NAM) and N-acetylglucosamine (NAG). A three-dimensional crystal structure emerges when these chains become cross-linked, contributing to the cell wall's robustness.

## Differences Between Gram-positive and Gram-negative Bacteria

The thickness and composition of the cell wall vary across bacterial species. **Gram-positive bacteria** are characterized by a thick layer of peptidoglycan, which absorbs the primary crystal violet stain during staining procedures, allowing these cells to be visualized under a microscope. In contrast, **Gram-negative bacteria** possess a thin layer of peptidoglycan and are usually surrounded by an additional layer of phospholipids. This structural difference means that Gram-negative bacteria do not retain the crystal violet stain but can be visualized with alternative staining methods.

## Staining Procedures and Observations

Applying a staining procedure to a bacterial sample allows for the differentiation of bacteria based on their cell wall components. A thick peptidoglycan layer absorbs the primary stain (crystal violet), making the Gram-positive bacteria visible under a microscope. Conversely, cells with absent or thin peptidoglycan layers will not hold the color from this primary stain. Subsequent labs will explore different stains to further differentiate between cell types in a sample.
