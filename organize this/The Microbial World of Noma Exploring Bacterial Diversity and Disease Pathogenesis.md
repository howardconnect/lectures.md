## Introduction
Our journey through microbiology has largely unfolded within the confines of a traditional biology classroom. However, this assignment stretches beyond academic boundaries to confront the tangible impact of diseases on vulnerable communities. This exploration is not solely for those on a path to healthcare careers; it's a call to empathy for anyone moved by human struggle. Embracing our institution's commitment to cultivating servant-leaders, we acknowledge that such leadership demands confronting the harsh realities of human suffering head-on.

## Instructions
- Read the accompanying article **Oro-facial Gangrene (Noma/Cancrum Oris): Pathogenetic Mechanisms** and answer the following questions.
- Strive to provide answers in the form of a complete sentence.

## **Questions**
Questions and potential (minus one exception) answers are related strictly to the article. Be sure to address what the question asks. I have provided some clues to most questions to help guide your answers.

1.      What are the various names by which this disease is referred?

2.      If you were to witness this disease during an overseas humanitarian mission, which regions of the world would you likely be in?

3.      Based on the research cited in the article, which country appears to have the highest incidence of the disease? (Identify the country and provide a brief explanation of why this might be the case.)

4.      What is the typical socioeconomic status of communities affected by this disease? (Examine how the living conditions, wealth, and access to healthcare and education within a community influence the spread of the disease.)

5.      List three common factors that contribute to the disease's occurrence. (Explain how these factors interact to facilitate the disease's spread.)

6.      When diagnosing this disease, what are two other conditions that must be considered? (Explain why these differential diagnoses are important to consider.)

7.      Identify three interventions that can halt the disease's progression. (Describe how each intervention contributes to managing or stopping the disease.)

8.      What are two diseases hypothesized to precede or act synergistically with this condition? (Briefly discuss how these conditions may be related to the primary disease.)

9.      Discuss two risks factor related to Protein-Energy Malnutrition (PEM) mentioned in the article. (In a few sentences, explain the role of this risk factor in the disease's development.)

10.  Identify and name the bacterial species mentioned in the article as being associated with the development of the disease (Hint: there are 10)

11.  For two of the bacterial species listed in response to the first question, describe their specific roles or contributions to the disease's pathogenesis as outlined in the article.
