::Q1:: Which is the best example of a population? {
    ~all the microbes living in a particular area
    ~all the microbes of a particular domain living in a particular area
    =all the microbes of a single species living in a particular area
    ~all the microbes living within the same host
}

::Q2:: Microbial ecology is defined as the study of which of the following? {
    ~competitive interactions between microbes
    ~cooperative interactions between microbes
    ~interactions between individuals of a single species
    =interactions between microbial populations and their environment
}

::Q3:: Protozoa are best described as being: {
    ~nonphotosynthetic multicellular microorganisms
    =nonphotosynthetic unicellular microorganisms
    ~photosynthetic multicellular microorganisms
    ~photosynthetic unicellular microorganisms
}

::Q4:: Pseudopod formation requires which cytoskeletal component? {
    =actin filaments
    ~collagen fibers
    ~intermediate filaments
    ~microtubules
}

::Q5:: Which term best describes the relationship between pathogenic bacteria and humans? {
    ~amensalism
    ~commensalism
    =parasitism
    ~predation
}

::Q6:: Which of the following is not a class within the phylum Proteobacteria? {
    ~Alphaproteobacteria
    ~Betaproteobacteria
    ~Deltaproteobacteria
    =Omegaproteobacteria
}

::Q7:: Which describes bacteria that require low concentrations of oxygen to survive (less than that in the current atmosphere)? {
    ~facultative anaerobes
    =microaerophiles
    ~obligate aerobes
    ~obligate anaerobes
}

::Q8:: Which of the following correctly describes the microscopic morphology of Bacteroides? {
    =gram-negative bacilli
    ~gram-negative cocci
    ~gram-positive bacilli
    ~gram-positive cocci
}

::Q9:: How do Archaea differ from Bacteria? {
    ~Archaea are found exclusively in extreme habitats.
    =Archaea have ether linkages in their cell membranes.
    ~Archaea have peptidoglycan cell walls.
    ~Archaea lack a nucleus.
}

::Q10:: Which best describes the class Halobacteria? {
    =archaeans that require highly saline environments
    ~archaeans that require methane-rich environments
    ~bacteria that require highly arid environments
    ~bacteria that require highly saline environments
}

::Q11:: Which of the following statements is incorrect? {
    =Fungi can be autotrophic or heterotrophic.
    ~Fungi can be pathogenic, mutualistic, or neither.
    ~Fungi can be unicellular or multicellular.
    ~Fungi have eukaryotic cells.
}

::Q12:: Match each type of association with the best example. {
    =amensalism -> A mold produces a chemical that kills bacteria without apparently benefiting.
    =commensalism -> Aerobic bacteria in the human colon consume oxygen, making it possible for anaerobic species to survive.
    =mutualism -> Flagellates live in the gut of termites, feeding on the wood consumed by the termite and allowing the termite access to nutrition and energy in wood that they could not otherwise digest.
    =parasitism -> A helminth takes up residence in a human digestive tract, consuming nutrients.
