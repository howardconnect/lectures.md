# Assignment: Foul Water, Fiery Serpent

## Introduction

As future professionals in the field of nursing and healthcare, it is imperative for students to grasp not only the theoretical underpinnings of diseases but also the real-world challenges involved in combating public health issues. This assignment, centered around the documentary "Foul Water, Fiery Serpent," provides an invaluable opportunity for pre-nursing students to explore the complexities of parasitic diseases, specifically the Guinea worm disease, and the global efforts undertaken to eradicate it.

## Description
