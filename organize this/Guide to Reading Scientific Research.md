# Guide to Reading Scientific Research

## Introduction

Understanding and forming educated opinions on scientific subjects necessitates familiarity with current research and the ability to discern credible studies from misinterpretations. This skill, crucial for professionals in science and medicine, including pre-nursing students, demands patience and practice.

## Note for Pre-Nursing Students

While the comprehensive steps outlined below are designed to enhance understanding of scientific papers, not all steps may be directly applicable or necessary for pre-nursing students. It's essential to focus on strategies that align with the scope of nursing practice and educational objectives.

## Universal Strategies for Reading Scientific Papers

These strategies are beneficial for students across disciplines, including pre-nursing, and can be applied to a wide range of scientific literature:

1. **Focus on the Introduction and Conclusion**: These sections provide the context and summary of the research, crucial for grasping the study's purpose and outcomes.
2. **Evaluate the Credibility of Sources**: Assess the authors, their affiliations, and the journal's reputation to ensure the research's reliability.
3. **Understand the Research Question**: Identifying the main question or problem addressed by the study is essential for contextualizing its significance.
4. **Summarize Key Findings**: Distilling the results into understandable terms aids in comprehension and application to nursing practice.
5. **Critically Assess the Conclusions**: Compare the study's conclusions with your understanding and consider their implications for nursing and healthcare.

## Reading Strategy

### Preliminary Considerations

#### Evaluating Sources and Authors

Before engaging with a paper, assess the credibility of the authors and their affiliations, as well as the journal's reputation, to avoid referencing biased or non-authoritative studies.

### Detailed Steps for In-depth Analysis

1. **Introduction First**: Begin with the paper's introduction to understand its context and objectives, postponing the abstract to avoid biases.
    
2. **The Big Question**: Identify the overarching question or problem the research addresses, which offers insight into the field's current challenges.
    
3. **Background Summary**: Concisely summarize prior research, noting the progression leading to the current study.
    
4. **Research Questions**: Note the specific questions or hypotheses the study aims to answer, clarifying the research's focus.
    
5. **Methodological Approach**: Familiarize yourself with the methods used to answer the research questions.
    
6. **Analyzing the Results**: Summarize the findings objectively, without interpreting their implications initially.
    
7. **Interpreting Findings**: Consider the significance of the results and how they contribute to answering the research questions.
    
8. **Conclusions and Discussions**: Review the authors' interpretations and compare them with your own.
    
9. **Abstract Review**: With a comprehensive understanding of the paper, review the abstract to evaluate its summary.
    
10. **External Reviews**: Explore other experts' opinions on the study to broaden your critique.
    

## Conclusion

This structured approach not only aids in understanding scientific papers but also fosters critical thinking and analytical skills, which are essential for navigating scientific literature and applying it within the nursing field.
