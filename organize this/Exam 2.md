# Exploring Antibodies and Phage Therapy





Before diving into the materials, you'll be presented with a series of multiple-choice questions that aim to challenge your existing knowledge and spark curiosity about the topics to be discussed.

## **Part 1: Pre-Reading Quiz**

Before delving into the Wired article and the case study on phage therapy, you are required to complete a set of pre-reading questions. This mini-quiz is integral to your exam and aims to prime your understanding of key concepts and details relevant to the upcoming materials. Please note:

- The questions in this quiz will contribute to your overall exam score.
- Points will be deducted for incorrect answers, and the point value decreases with each attempt, emphasizing the importance of accuracy and first-time comprehension.
- This quiz, along with other components, will be accessible on our Moodle course under the designated exam section.

Attempt these questions with careful consideration, as they are structured to both test your existing knowledge and prepare you for the in-depth exploration of phage therapy and the battle against antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

What is the primary function of antibodies in the human body?

A) To serve as structural components of cell membranes
B) To act as messengers between immune cells
C) To identify and neutralize foreign objects like bacteria and viruses
D) To facilitate the transport of nutrients across cell membranes

According to the discussions in the lecture and documents, why can phage therapy be an alternative to antibiotics?

A) Phages can increase the effectiveness of antibiotics
B) Phages specifically target and destroy bacteria without harming the bodyâ€™s cells
C) Phages can replace all functions of the immune system
D) Phages are easier to produce than antibodies

Which statement best describes the role of antigens?

A) Antigens always cause diseases in humans
B) Antigens are produced by the body in response to an infection
C) Antigens are foreign substances that trigger an immune response
D) Antigens are a type of white blood cell

Part 2: Wired Article Exploration

After answering the pre-reading questions, please read or listen to the Wired article on phage therapy. This article provides a contemporary look at the application of bacteriophages in combating antibiotic-resistant infections.

Part 3: Post-Reading Questions

Following your exploration of the Wired article, reflect on how the content relates to the initial questions and address the additional query below:

The Wired article and the case study on phage therapy highlighted a challenge with phage therapy related to the immune system. What was it?

A) The immune system always enhances the effectiveness of phage therapy
B) The immune system can develop antibodies that neutralize the bacteriophages
C) The immune system cannot detect bacteriophages
D) Bacteriophages can replace the immune system in fighting infections

Part 4: Case Study Analysis

Next, delve into the provided case study, which offers a detailed examination of phage therapy in a clinical setting. This case study will give you insights into the practical challenges and successes of applying phage therapy to real-world antibiotic-resistant infections.

Part 5: Reflection and Discussion

Option 1

Consider the ethical implications, the challenges posed by the immune system, and the advantages of targeting specific bacteria without disrupting the beneficial microbiota.

Option 2

Conclude the assignment with a brief essay or discussion post in your learning management system, reflecting on the potential of phage therapy as an alternative to traditional antibiotics.



Submission Guidelines:

Please submit your answers to the multiple-choice questions, along with your reflection essay or discussion post, by [insert due date here]. Your work will be evaluated based on accuracy, depth of analysis, and the ability to connect theoretical concepts with practical applications.

This assignment structure aims to engage you actively with the material, encouraging a critical examination of the topics discussed and fostering a comprehensive understanding of the role of antibodies, antigens, and phage therapy in the field of microbiology and immunology.
