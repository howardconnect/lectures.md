### The Importance of Field of View Calculations for Medical Microbiology Students

Learning to calculate the field of view helps predominantly getting a feel for understanding microscopic scales involved with microbes such as bacteria. These are otherwise invisible to the naked eye. This task, while it may not be a frequent requirement in your future professional activities, sharpens your hands-on abilities in using microscopes—a fundamental instrument in microbiology. 
## Objective:
To calculate the field of view at different magnifications using a known reference size. Students will use a microscope with a slide of the letter "e", which has a known diameter of 5mm, to estimate the field of view at two higher magnifications beyond 4x.

## Materials:
- Compound microscope
- Slide with a printed letter "e" (5mm in diameter)
- Ruler or a micrometer scale (optional for initial measurement)

## Instructions:

### Part 1: Reference Measurement at 4x Magnification
1. **Initial Measurement:**
   - Place the letter "e" slide on the microscope stage and secure it.
   - Using the 4x objective lens, bring the letter "e" into focus.
   - Note: The diameter of the letter "e" is 5mm. This will serve as your reference for calculating the field of view at higher magnifications.

### Part 2: Calculating Field of View at Higher Magnifications
1. **Medium Power (e.g., 10x Objective Lens):**
   - Switch to the 10x objective lens and bring the letter into focus.
   - Calculate the diameter of the field of view at this magnification using the known size of the letter "e".
   - Record your calculation method and the estimated field of view diameter.

2. **High Power (e.g., 40x Objective Lens):**
   - Switch to the 40x objective lens. Be careful not to let the lens touch the slide.
   - Repeat the calculation process for the field of view diameter.
   - Record your calculation method and the estimated field of view diameter.

### Part 3: Converting to Micrometers
1. **Conversion:**
   - Convert your field of view diameter measurements from millimeters to micrometers (1 mm = 1000 µm).
   - Record the field of view diameter for each magnification level in both millimeters and micrometers.

### Part 4: Observation and Drawing
1. **Draw the Letter "e":**
   - Under each magnification level, draw how the letter "e" appears in the field of view.
   - Label each drawing with the magnification level and the calculated field of view diameter.

2. **Questions:**
   - Describe how you calculated the field of view diameter at each magnification level.
   - Discuss how the field of view changes with increasing magnification.

## Submission:
- Submit your calculations, conversion, drawings, and answers to the questions.
- Include a brief explanation of your observations regarding field of view and magnification.
